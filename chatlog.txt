samriegel @azazel0189 I was specifically told to wear a white shirt, and I totally Biffed
tiamatzx Although this begs the question: in wizard's chess, once the pieces are destroyed, do they end up regenerating? If not, I'm sure it would be quite expensive to replace them.

kogasagasagasa @slixbadtouch Sacred Flame is a normal Action to cast, and a cantrip. The rule on multiple spells per turn is for leveled spells - It is legal in standard 5e rules to cast spiritual weapon and follow up with a cantrip.

ryralane @Mattitudinal We're doing Shattered Star. He's a Chaotic Neutral follower of Calistria that follows the idea of "Calistria's teachings are of love, not just lust. Love for everyone." We have a follower of Shelyn who subscribes more to the normal idea of love, so it creates some fun conflict. My character's beliefs are being brought into question because of Kasadei, though. She's a cutie!

thepurbleking @miranda_ghost I think you're confusing "equal" with "exactly the same". Not to mention that that has nothing to do with equality anyway
kogasagasagasa I think that it's good to have the chess moves be on initiative count of 20 (or, if you prefer turn order, 20 and 15, or some other number) if anyone's interested in running chessgames in D&D.

mattitudinal @Ryralane That sounds pretty badass. Very devout follower of Calistria, methinks. My Cartomancer is a follower of Nethys, and Nethys really is kind of a 'eh, do what you want' kind of god, as long as you use magic. Thankfully, she can do that quite well.

jeshuea even with his advantage on his death save he got a 7?
z3rg0 @murpheus__ even then, there might be some loopholes in it that could end up being very crazy. However, from what I recall, they can be very tanky or very damagy. I myself would prefer to use in my campaign an illusion wizard with phantasmal force, but idunno what theme you want for you villain, so if you're comfortable with the class, fuck yes lol

murpheus__ @z3rg0 alright, good to know, I'll check both options before my players get to him, he is meant to be a ridiculously tough villain to fight, hence why I chose the bullshit that is the mystic class
thewinterwren @LuluTheGamingArtist yes
roseavenefica Magic missile is one roll for all the darts
launcelot69 @thepurbleking That's how MM works.

ephemeraldisle @ThePurbleKing Look at page 196 in the PHB, describing how damage rolls work. still, in my games you roll for each dart because it's more fun
ltbabylucien omg

avalikia Liam is trying to knock the king prone...
james_peach hey, bunder was knocking chess pieces prone before it was cooll

rhymeswithpi oh hey, i don't have to wait 'til the ungodly hours of the evening to watch the vod!
caiaden it sounds like its kinda lagging and it drags the pitches super out of tune
knightoflightning I can't wait for the Mighty Nein to return next week.

seariyu How was the second half? I was a bit behind
invitalis a one short amirite
champlooronin029 Twitch can be kinda squishy depending on everyone’s individual bandwidth, when they popped in(at least on a “live” stream), and, it seems maybe, how many are watching simultaneously. She’s a fickle mistress, that Twitch.
zslayer18 it was good @seariyu
nyxnoxx Twinnies </3

dreadlow yea it wasn't "short" in any sense of negativity, just short in that it went by fast. a lot happened and it was well paced. everyone elses one shots usually go from 3-4 hours as well, so it's nothing different.

zslayer18 i mean technically its still thursday in CR land
revisualize IT IS THURSDAY!!!!!!!!!
zslayer18 but yes i wish it was next thursday
spearo75 Definitely one of my favorite one shots that they have done
revisualize I'd love to see a good 6 hour show.
revisualize What's the longest ep ever?
revisualize Critical Role Stats!
zslayer18 @revisualize it was either episode 88 or episode 114
zslayer18 if you are talking about purely CR gameplay
champlooronin029 I’m assuming the final boss fight from campaign 1 is pretty far up there.
revisualize 114
sunshiney74 ep 114- critrole stats puts it at 5:09 game play time
tfwfangirlsatk https://twitter.com/my2k/status/1054470699530764291
revisualize 5 hours and 37 min.
tfwfangirlsatk AWWWWWWW
multimediapanda was this the shortest?
zslayer18 @Multimediapanda the shortest one shot? no, Sam's Crash pandas was shorter
revisualize Damn... Why was 114 that long?
multimediapanda oh :o I haven't gotten to that one yet
revisualize Why was ep 88 so long?
zslayer18 long battle
multimediapanda Goodnight everyone <3
zslayer18 started after break and it just dragged on
sunshiney74 good night @Multimediapanda
sunshiney74 88 was definitely quite the battle
champlooronin029 Ummm... they had to deal with some pretty intense shite in 114. Like...an ascended almost-god.
champlooronin029 88 was bananas as well.
zslayer18 let's be careful of spoilers please

tfwfangirlsatk Hey CC!
criticalcantrip howdy darling -- enjoy the one shot?
tfwfangirlsatk SO MUCH
tfwfangirlsatk Do you know I have a Harry Potter tattoo?
criticalcantrip guess who ordered the art book mid show
tfwfangirlsatk And that The Breakfast Club is my favorite?
criticalcantrip oh wow no! that's awesome what does it look like?
weilert is it over?
tfwfangirlsatk You did? That's great!
tfwfangirlsatk @weilert Yup!
criticalcantrip yes, you can watch the VOD if you sub to G&S or proejct alpha
weilert kk, ty
tfwfangirlsatk CC - It's the Deathly Hallows Symbol with Always written under it

tfwfangirlsatk I kept hoping that Liam and Sam would forget the guys and get together
criticalcantrip :P
criticalcantrip I was in the bunker trying to NOT make wand jokes but never fear--- they did it for us
champlooronin029 Thanks! One of my favorite things about this community is how inclusive and understanding everyone is. Gonna see myself out now. Beep beep and bidet!

tfwfangirlsatk How's that a spoiler?
sunshiney74 @GalapagosTurtle The folks over at gns are saying rebroadcast in about 15 mins
criticalcantrip (looks around with a conspiratorial glance to see if anyone who hasn't seen the shoe yet is here)
galapagosturtle @sunshiney74 thx dude :D
criticalcantrip not everyone knows the gag yet
tfwfangirlsatk *blinks confused*
galapagosturtle shoeonhead?
tfwfangirlsatk Only thing I know is Markiplier put a box of Cheezits on his head
criticalcantrip better than planking
tfwfangirlsatk But that's all I know about things being put on the head
criticalcantrip shoe *show
tfwfangirlsatk But the Rick Moranis thing could literally be anything
tfwfangirlsatk I know lots of random trivia about movies
zslayer18 Holy crap I just went upstairs to check a few things before bed, and this little bit of light was shining against this big lamp my family has in our family room, the shadow looked just like a persons shadow standing right outside the window
zslayer18 I almost just screamed
criticalcantrip jump scares are not fun in real life
criticalcantrip :/
tfwfangirlsatk Oh man!
tfwfangirlsatk I did that when I watched The Babadook
tfwfangirlsatk I saw a coat on the ground and I really did scream and run upstairs
tfwfangirlsatk I know your pain Z
tfwfangirlsatk It is NOT fun
tfwfangirlsatk You ever do that CC?
criticalcantrip I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder. Yeah. Sadly. I had coworkers who thought it was funny to startle me in a retail job once. I would faint.
tfwfangirlsatk Oh CC, that sucks...
tfwfangirlsatk Did they give you those nasty wafer things that you put under your tongue that cost a fortune?
criticalcantrip I only worked there a few months, and I burned them good on the way out, so eh. But at the time I ws not diagnosed, and did not realize I was dangerously spiking my blood pressure
tfwfangirlsatk That sucks so much
criticalcantrip It wasn't until my first ward visit that they caught it at ... what was the high number.. 186?
tfwfangirlsatk Holy fuck
tfwfangirlsatk Oops
criticalcantrip yeah I coulda died. Like a lot in my life apparently. because genetics, and stress are bad. and we found that out.
tfwfangirlsatk I cussed
tfwfangirlsatk Sorry mods
tfwfangirlsatk I kinda want to come and kick some asses for you
criticalcantrip nothing like 4 nurses in one room becuse they are worried you could have stroked out. whee?
criticalcantrip your vigor is appriciated, but aim it at someone who's on the other side of the journey. I'm happy, stable, supported, help the ones who aren't
revisualize YOu know that moment when you hit ALT+Q vs ALT+W ... Crushing.
criticalcantrip oh no
criticalcantrip alt-z?
revisualize Doesn't work when you close chrome.
criticalcantrip ohhhh
criticalcantrip boo
tfwfangirlsatk History?
criticalcantrip my mother deletes everything, every time. I can't convince her not to. Then gets frustrated she can't find things
revisualize Yeah. I goofed.
revisualize I had to CTRL+SHIFT+T a bunch of times.
tfwfangirlsatk Lolol, is your mom scared of leaving porn on the computer?
tfwfangirlsatk The only people I know who do that are because of porn reasons
criticalcantrip that's a little off color love
tfwfangirlsatk Sorry
tfwfangirlsatk Oh wait
criticalcantrip she's just fussy about things in a vaguely OCD way and thinks every tab should be closed every time.
tfwfangirlsatk Thank you for pointing that out
tfwfangirlsatk And I will strive to do better
criticalcantrip You're welcome, no worries
tfwfangirlsatk (Did I do it right?)
criticalcantrip passes a CR logo sugar cookie to @tfwfangirlsatk
criticalcantrip yep, next step -- keep on trucking
criticalcantrip Sorry you had a goof @revisualize
tfwfangirlsatk Which is worse to you guys
criticalcantrip hmm?
tfwfangirlsatk Slightly blurry pic or pixelated pic?
criticalcantrip brian's accent or his hair? tough choice ;)
tfwfangirlsatk Heheheh
criticalcantrip blurry
criticalcantrip pixels can seem like a cool effect but some of my favorite photos are f'ups in the blur department. A litle less so with Live photos in Appleand picking a better moment.
tfwfangirlsatk I meant more in like a wallpaper versus actual paper
tfwfangirlsatk I am slep
tfwfangirlsatk I think I shall go sleep
tfwfangirlsatk Night CC!
criticalcantrip g'night dear
geniespool stay up late to watch the vod? or stay up late tomorrow night to watch the vod?
tfwfangirlsatk I hope that your day is full of laughter and joy
criticalcantrip tought call, watch to the break? it's an early break
criticalcantrip thank you @tfwfangirlsatk ditto
tfwfangirlsatk Do you work Saturday Genies?
geniespool no
tfwfangirlsatk Tomorrow
tfwfangirlsatk Unless you don't work tomorrow either
tfwfangirlsatk In which case, yolo
geniespool i've seen to the middle of the sprite fight at the start.
tfwfangirlsatk You've got a long ways to go after that iirc
geniespool work tomorrow plus theater in the evening
tfwfangirlsatk Then definitely do it tomorrow
tfwfangirlsatk It's a great episode, but that's a lot of work
geniespool 2hours and around 20 minutes to watch i think
tfwfangirlsatk Something like that, yeah
tfwfangirlsatk I dunno what your timezone is, but it;s almost 2 here
tfwfangirlsatk So that'd be a lot on a long day
khal_memaybe ah shucks, did i miss the show?
tfwfangirlsatk Yup!

theproudpanenby Aw yis
tfwfangirlsatk Oh yeah, I think the cast will have something to say about things come next week
tfwfangirlsatk But I'mma not say anything and go to bed
tfwfangirlsatk I hope everyone has a good night
criticalcantrip I am so HAPPY my players are finally going to meet their trans firbolg guide to the guilds of waterdeeep. She's gonna be such fun to meet.
criticalcantrip how's your evening @TheProudPanEnby
geniespool almost 11pm here... gonna probably miss more thursdays coming up live since the Lakers are on prime time tv so often.
criticalcantrip to each their own. enjoy your bliss
geniespool i can watch CR vods thanks to subbing.
geniespool but i haven't paid for NBA league pass to watch those games via VOD, so i try to catch them live
criticalcantrip subs are creeping in my budget
criticalcantrip I gotta decide about Star Trek for next season might grab it for a few months
geniespool alpha, gands, and CR is ~120 a year, including twitch prime benefit. but is also easier to stomach since monthly. NBA league pass is around 150 for the season i think, and all up front
criticalcantrip hmmms
criticalcantrip 40 bucks amonth to cover everything that pops early --amazon prime, microsoft office etc.
criticalcantrip *yearly
criticalcantrip 53 a month to coer apple storage, music, hp ink, googleplay which is also youtube premium, patreon, and alpha
criticalcantrip and 22 for a service that strips commericals for me off tv because we work for cable and get every channel but hate commercials...
criticalcantrip and it's still cheaper than a cable sub for a normal human with internet. yay benefits
criticalcantrip (also yay ynab.com)
criticalcantrip hey guys, did anyone know there was a firefly book? https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38464992?rto=x_gr_e_nl_newreleases&utm_medium=email&utm_source=new_releases&utm_campaign=2018_11&utm_content=science_fiction_2&ref_=pe_3349310_365369080
